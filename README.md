The shell script inside this repository counts the number of occurences of the word 'de' in a text file. Specifically I used the wikipedia page of Rijksuniversiteit Groningen which can be found via https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen. The result of 234 times the word 'de' is from the page that was downloaded on march 15th at 12:42 CET.
